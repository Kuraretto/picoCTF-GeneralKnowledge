Description
The Multiverse is within your grasp! Unfortunately, the server that contains the secrets of the multiverse is in a universe where keyboards only have numbers and (most) symbols.

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

first we launch the instance in the challenge 

then we open the terminal and connect with the instance using ssh as given in the challenege 

as soon as we connect with the instance i tried using a few comamnds like ls, cd , etc 
but none of them worked 

then i refered about this online and saw that there were 
-Wildcards 
-Golbbing 

links for both 

https://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm (Wildcard)

https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/globbingref.html (Gobbing)

these are the few characters which we aer going to be using in this challenge 

? : match 1 character, ex. /??? -> /bin /dev 

* : match 0 or more characters, ex. /lib* -> /lib /lib32 

[ ] : matches any single character within the specified range or set, ex. file[345].txt or file[3â€“5].txt -> file3.txt, file4.txt, file5.txt

[!] : matches any character that is not in the specified range or set, ex. file[!12].txt -> any files from file0.txt-file9.txt, except file1.txt and file2.txt

with this i started searching for the flag file and which directory i was in 

i tried ./*

and it said i was in the ./blargh directory 

then when i tried doing 

./*/*

it showed be that 

./blargh/flag.txt : Permission denied

then i focused on searching for the other directory, i kept adding /? till i was able to find the other directory

ex : /???, /????, /?????, /?????? etc 

by using this method i was able to find that the path of the flag was 

/home/ctf-player/blargh/flag.txt

after this step i was stuck and started to look for writeups online and went through this

after trying to undestand how it was done i got the idea and tried it 
for future reference please look into the link above 

i was able to get the flag by using this cmd 
"/???/???[!_]64 /????/??????????/??????/????????"

but this only retured the flag encryptred using base 64 

so i took the output and pasted it on cyberchef and used the from base64 recipe to decrypt the flag
