pretty easy challenge 

first we connect to the server using the instructions provided in the challenge
once we are conencted to the server, we check which directory we are in 
using the ls -all command, we know that we have to access the root directory to find the flag, so to access the root directory we need to have permission to check our current permissions, i use the command sudo -l this shows us a hint 

User picoplayer may run the following commands on challenge:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/vi


using this clue i run the comamnd 

sudo vi <file_name> 

i went with test as the file name 

it opens up a vi editor were we write another command 

:!/bin/bash

for more command like this you can refer 

https://gtfobins.github.io/

once you run that in the editor and press enter we get root access, then you navigate back to the root folder and this time we should be able to get access into it, and see the contents inside the folder, we can see that there is a folder named flag.txt 

using the cat command we can view our flag
