Rust fixme 1

Description
Have you heard of Rust? Fix the syntax errors in this Rust file to print the flag!

when looking at the code and reading the comments all the errors in the code was mentioned and 
it was a very easy fix 

first we run the code using "cargo run"

the compiler throws all the reported errors 

the first was adding a ";"

let key = String::from("CSUCKS") // <- missing `;`

so we add the ;

the next error is the return 

ret; // <- `ret` doesnâ€™t exist in Rust

ret is invalid the correct one is "return"

the third error which i found was 

println!(
    ":?", // <- invalid, needs a placeholder like "{}"
    String::from_utf8_lossy(&decrypted_buffer)
);


replace that with 

println!("Decrypted flag: {}",String::from_utf8_lossy(&decrypted_buffer));

once you fix these 3 errors save the .rs file and run it again using "congo run" 

this time it should print the output
