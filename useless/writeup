very easy challenege 

launch the instance and connect to the serbver using ssh by using the creds given in the challeneg 

using this command we connect to the server 

ssh -p 51559 picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net

once inside the server we use the ls command to see the files in the directorty 
we see that there is file names useless and when checked the file type using the file command we see that it is a shell command 

and when i tried running it by using the ./ command it returned read the code first, so i used the cat command to read the code and saw that more info can be obtained by using the man command so i use 

man useless 

and it gives us the output with the flag
